# Fast, Light Driver Station (FL-DS)


- FL-DS is a FRC driver station for linux built on the LibDS and FLTK frameworks, it's primary goal is to be lightweight
- FRC is a international robotics competition for high school students, I am a member of #8230 the Koibots 
- LibDS is a framework for building custom driver stations with C, FLTK is a C++ GUI framework made to be lightweight

### Disclaimers:
This is not meant to actually be used as a driver station, my own team will not be using it. This is more of an experiment for my own learning. If your team is interested in actually using it, reach out to me and I will take it's development a little more seriosly 



Please contribute however you like, if you are contributing you probably know more about this than me
I am not using any sort of conventions and wish it to stay that way, (I guess all caps can be used for constants but it is not neccesary)
A more important convention is that all names are short, NOTHING should be over 20 characters in length.



disclaimer:
I am a high shcool student who is not currently in any cs classes and have never been in a class teaching any of the software I am using so please don't blame me for it being total crap, thank you
